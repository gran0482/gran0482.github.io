        <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>
       My name is Ben Grant, and this is my first year at Algonquin College. I am a recent graduate from South Carleton High School here in Ottawa. During high school I took many communications technology courses that helped me become interested in the Interactive Media Design program. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After “graduation” and during quarantine I enjoyed experimenting with the Adobe programs to create different logos and designs and to develop my creative skill set. I am interested in possible careers in photography, graphic design, page layout or digital illustration. I look forward to building my skills and learning new content that will allow me to build my skill set through the IMD program
    </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies inclue:</p>  
    <ol>
        <li>Practicing photography</li>
        <li>Staying active</li>
        <li>Experimenting with different artistic styles</li> 
        <li>Watching Youtube, Netflix and TiK Toks</li>
    </ol>
