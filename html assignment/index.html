   <p>
       My name is Ben Grant, and this is my first year at Algonquin College. I am a recent graduate from South Carleton High School here in Ottawa. During high school I took many communications technology courses that helped me become interested in the Interactive Media Design program.

        After “graduation” and during quarantine I enjoyed experimenting with the Adobe programs to create different logos and designs and to develop my creative skill set. I am interested in possible careers in photography, graphic design, page layout or digital illustration. I look forward to building my skills and learning new content that will allow me to build my skill set through the IMD program
