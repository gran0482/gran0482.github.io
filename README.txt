Description
When creating my website I wanted it to maintain a professional look and feel all through out to bring in potential work. 

I chose to go with 3 colours to avoid having to many colours present. I also decided to 1 dark for a background colour and 1 light colour to use for text that is placed on the dark background. I chose 1 bright colour as an accent colour to bring attention to certain titles, call to action buttons, card backgrounds and hover states. 

I wanted to have one font in my site to maintain consistency and to avoid having too many fonts. I also wanted to choose a font that appeared friendly, was easy to read and had different font weights so that it would allow me to bold text or make it bigger if I needed to.

On my website, I wanted to chose images and digital artwork that I felt best represented who I am and best represent my skills. I chose to include my portfolio because I wanted my website to appear simplitic and easy to navigate without too many pages to go through. By including my portfolio it allows people to see more of my work within in my website.
