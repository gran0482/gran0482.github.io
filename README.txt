Description
When creating my website I wanted it to maintain a professional look and feel all through out to bring in potential work. 

I chose to go with 3 colours to avoid having to many colours present. I also decided to 1 dark for a background colour and 1 light colour to use for text that is placed on the dark background. I chose 1 bright colour as an accent colour to bring attention to certain titles, call to action buttons, card backgrounds and hover states. 

I wanted to have one font in my site to maintain consistency and to avoid having too many fonts. I also wanted to choose a font that appeared friendly, was easy to read and had different font weights so that it would allow me to bold text or make it bigger if I needed to.

On my website, I wanted to chose images and digital artwork that I felt best represented who I am and best represent my skills. I chose to include my portfolio because I wanted my website to appear simplitic and easy to navigate without too many pages to go through. By including my portfolio it allows people to see more of my work within in my website. 

Challenges
Challenge #1 unfunctioning bootstrap navigation 
During production when I was testing my website for user-functionality I noticed that my drop down menu was not functioning properly. I first checked my code to make sure I didn't take out any bootstrap element that came with the navigation. Then I began to google how to fix the issue to see what possible errors I could have made. This gave me a few ideas of what to look at and try. I tried fixing those tips based on my google search. Those tips did not work and then I decided to put a new bootstrap element template in to see if it did fix the issue. It fixed the issue and I learned that when using bootstrap its important to have the <script></script> function in your page for the elements to work. 

Challenge #2 Helicopter banner image 
When I added the helicopter image as the banner image I wanted the helicopter to be visible at all times. Originally when the viewport size grew so did the helicopter image and only the blades of were visible. To solve this problem I googled my issue and found a codepen that helped me understand the object-position property that I was looking for. Now when the viewport grows in size the helicopter is always visible.

Challenge #3 card text and image issue - When designing my cards in the About page below the graphic design area I tried to have the text stay in one place when the viewport size grew. The text would not stay in the same place and would often go outside of the container I had it in. Also, the same similar issue was happening with my images. I had to try and make all the images the same size and they would fit the container appropriately. Since I had a bootstrap template in place I decided to replace my cards with the prebuilt cards that bootstrap has. This allowed me to fix both my image and text issue so all the elements would stay the same size when resizing to mobile, tablet or desktop.

Challenge #4 Self portrait stretching (About page) - During designing my about page I included a self portrait of myself and when the viewport resized and my image stretched in a vertical way. To work around this issue I had to set a fixed height and width to avoid this issue and it would look the same size in mobile, tablet and desktop. 

Challenge #5 side bar scrolling (About page)

Challenge #6 Absolute vs Relative path
