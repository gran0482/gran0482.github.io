    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from South Carleton High School here in Ottawa. During high school I took many communications technology courses that helped me become interested in the Interactive Media Design program. </p>
    <p>After “graduation” and during quarantine I enjoyed experimenting with the Adobe programs to create different logos and designs and develop my creative skill set. I am interested in possible careers in photography, graphic design, page layout or digital illustration. I look forward to building my skills and learning new content that will allow me to build my skillset through the IMD program.</p>
    <h3>Motivational Quote</h3>
    <P>Gary Vee is an entrepreneur that I enjoy quoting. One is my favourite quotes is:
       <cite> <b>WITHOUT HUSTLE</b>, YOUR TALENT WILL ONLY GET YOU <b>SO FAR</b><sup>1</sup> </P></cite>
