        <h2><article><p style="color:#e2e2e2";>About Me</p></h2></article>
    <p>My name is Ben Grant, and this is my first year at Algonquin College. I am a recent graduate from South Carleton High School here in Ottawa. During high school I took many communications technology courses that helped me become interested in the Interactive Media Design program. </p>
    <p>After “graduation” and during quarantine I enjoyed experimenting with the Adobe programs to create different logos and designs and to develop my creative skill set. I am interested in possible careers in photography, graphic design, page layout or digital illustration. I look forward to building my skills and learning new content that will allow me to build my skill set through the IMD program.</p>
